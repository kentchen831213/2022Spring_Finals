# Covid 19 epidemic simulation
## Description


### Coding descript

For hypotheses 1,2 and 4, we combine them into one python script(bouncing_ball.py) in the hypothesis_1_2_4 folder. Users can set which hypothesis they want to test and set the number of corresponding parameters on the top of the script. For example, for hypothesis1, users can set the RATE_VACCINE to see the different coverage of vaccines how to influence epidemic transmission. For hypothesis2, users can set RATE_MASK to see the relationship between the coverage rate of masks and epidemic transmission rate. Lastly, users can set different numbers of DECREASE_RATE to test the hypothesis4.
